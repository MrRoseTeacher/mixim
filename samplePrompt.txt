SAMPLE PROMPT (Replace ## and words in CAPS)
Hello, I have a game shell created and I'd like your help generating content for the game. In the attached file, you can see the formatting. There needs to be a topic, pairs of words and descriptions/definitions, and a success message. It's important that the data file includes the information in that order. To be more specific with the words that are paired with the descriptions/definitions, please make sure that they are single words. Ideally, the words are less than 9 characters in length to avoid a line break on mobile phones.

Please generate a json file for me containing ## word/description pairs about TOPIC. INCLUDE ANY SPECIFIC NOTES.

The application uses UTF-8 characters, so if you need any symbols from other languages please use that formatting. If the content is math related, you may also use appropriate MathJax in the descriptions. Please note that the text will be imported into an input HTML tag, so please use escape characters in your MathJax code (such as \\neq instead of \neq).
